# Swift ID

This library provides two types which you can use to add identifiers to your entities. One is an incrementing id, called IID, and the other is a timestamp id called TID.

## TODO:

Make the types thread-safe using GCD. I don't know how to do that exactly yet, but I think this article might have the answer to that: [https://www.raywenderlich.com/79149/grand-central-dispatch-tutorial-swift-part-1](https://www.raywenderlich.com/79149/grand-central-dispatch-tutorial-swift-part-1).
